# My Sample OSC Proyect

---

In this proyect I connect an Arduino Mega with an Osciloscope software with a comunication protocol.
The Arduino has 2 functions, first ir to generate a a.c. voltage with a R2R circuit.
And second is to read the output of the circuit and send it to the sofrware across the serial port
to visualize the wave.
The software function is to visualize and control the arduino changing the time of the shots across the Serial Port
